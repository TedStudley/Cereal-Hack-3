				<p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children.</p>
<h2>Radioactive Man</h2>
<p>Inflammable means flammable? What a country. What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?</p>

<li>Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</li>
<li>I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</li>

<h3>The Last Temptation of Homer</h3>
<p>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman &mdash; and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Look out, Itchy! He's Irish! I didn't get rich by signing checks.</p>
